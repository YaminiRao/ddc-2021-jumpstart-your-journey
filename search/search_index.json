In order to better understand the data, we can use visualizations such as charts, plots, and graphs. We'll use some common tools such as matplotlib and seaborn and gather some statistical insights into our data. We'll continue to use the insurance.csv file from you project assets, so if you have not already downloaded this file to your local machine, and uploaded it to your project, do that now. If you have not already done so, make sure that you do the work for your project setup Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 Instead of writing code in a text file and then running the code with a Python command in the terminal, you can do all of your data analysis in one place. Code, output, tables, and charts can all be edited and viewed in one window in any web browser with Jupyter Notebooks . As the name suggests, this is a notebook to keep all of your ideas and data explorations in one place. Jupyter notebooks are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Open the Jupyter notebook \u00b6 Go the (\u2630) navigation menu and under the Projects section click on All Projects . Click the project name you created in the pre-work section. From your Project overview page, click on the Assets tab to open the assets page where your project assets are stored and organized. Scroll down to the Notebooks section of the page and click on the pencil icon at the right of the insurance-expenses-vizualization.ipynb notebook. When the Jupyter notebook is loaded and the kernel is ready, we will be ready to start executing it in the next section. Run the Jupyter notebook \u00b6 Spend some time looking through the sections of the notebook to get an overview. A notebook is composed of text (markdown or heading) cells and code cells. The markdown cells provide comments on what the code is designed to do. You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the Run button at the top of the notebook or hitting the keyboard short cut to run the cell ( Shift + Enter but can vary based on platform). While the cell is running, an asterisk ( [*] ) will show up to the left of the cell. When that cell has finished executing a sequential number will show up (i.e. [17] ). Note: Some of the comments in the notebook (those in bold red) are directions for you to modify specific sections of the code. Perform any changes as indicated before running / executing the cell. Load and Prepare Dataset \u00b6 Section 2.0 Load the data will load the data set we will use to build out machine learning model. In order to import the data into the notebook, we are going to use the code generation capability of Watson Studio. Highlight the code cell below by clicking it. Ensure you place the cursor below the first comment line. Click the 01/00 \"Find data\" icon in the upper right of the notebook to find the data asset you need to import. For your dataset, Click Insert to code and choose Insert Pandas DataFrame . The code to bring the data into the notebook environment and create a Pandas DataFrame will be added to the cell below. Run the cell and you will see the first five rows of our dataset. Since we are using generated code to import the data, you will need to update the next cell to assign the df variable. Copy the variable that was generated in the previous cell ( it will look like df=data_df_1 , data_df_2 , etc) and assign it to the df variable (for example df=df_data_1 ). Continue to run the notebook \u00b6 Finishing running all of the cells.

Conclusion"},{"location":"python3/","text":"Learning Python3 \u00b6 What is Python? \u00b6 From the Python.org documentation : Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective. You might think that Python is only for developers and people with computer science degrees. However, Python is great for beginners, even those with little coding experience because it\u2019s free, open source, and runs on any platform. The Python packages documentation is great, and after an introductory course , you have a good foundation to build on. For Data Scientists, Python has become an invaluable tool.

A notebook is composed of text (markdown or heading) cells and code cells. The markdown cells provide comments on what the code is designed to do. You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the Run button at the top of the notebook or hitting the keyboard short cut to run the cell (Shift + Enter but can vary based on platform).
